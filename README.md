# Running CAN on Mac&reg;

_Running CAN on Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
The macOS driver for TouCAN USB interfaces from [Rusoku](https://www.rusoku.com) is based on _MacCAN-Core_ which is an abstraction (or rather a wrapper) of AppleÂ´s IOUsbKit to create USB user-space drivers for CAN interfaces from various vendors under macOS.

## SwiftCAN-TouCAN

This repo contains only a little example program that uses the [MacCAN-TouCAN](https://github.com/mac-can/RusokuCAN/)  Swift Wrapper as a required package dependency.
Feel free to modify the program.
